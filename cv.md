I am a beginner front-end developer.

I become familia with web development about a year ago. At this period of time I've attended courses and have studed by my self. 
Now I realy in HTML and CSS, have stronge knowlege of basic JS, can do stuff using JQuery and Bootstrap.
I do not afraid of learning.  Every single minute I try to catch new information. 
I absorb everything like a sponge, may be not so fast as I'd like to. But if I'm familiar with something, it will be strong knowledge.
